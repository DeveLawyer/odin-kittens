## Odin Kittens

A fast and straightforward project, part of [The Odin Project Ruby on Rails track](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/kittens-api), where I set up a Rails app to be a data-producing API. This meant that my controller methods rendered data instead of HTML. This was a quick way to be introduced into building a pure vanilla RESTful resource. I used the rest-client gem and rendered my controller methods with JSON.
